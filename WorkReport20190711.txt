Hi Libo,

I have created a Linux account for you on our new build server for the 5G project. The server is:

Hostname:  john.casa-systems.com
IP Address: 172.25.2.100

Your ssh credentials are:

Username: lsun
Password: lsun123

You can change this by logging into john.casa-systems.com and entering the following command:   yppasswd

Youâ€™ll need to enter the password above as your current password, then a new password twice to confirm.

-Mike
